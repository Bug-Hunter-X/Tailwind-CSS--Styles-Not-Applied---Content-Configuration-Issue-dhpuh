# Tailwind CSS Configuration Error: Styles Not Applied

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tailwind CSS configurations where styles fail to be applied due to an incorrectly configured `content` option. The issue arises when the paths specified in `content` do not accurately reflect the location of your template files (HTML, JSX, TSX, etc.).

## Problem

Tailwind CSS directives are not being processed, resulting in styles not being applied to elements.  This frequently happens when the `content` option within your `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs` file contains incorrect or incomplete file paths.  Tailwind uses the `content` option to scan your templates and extract the CSS utility classes you're using.

## Solution

Ensure that the file paths specified within the `content` array accurately reflect the location of your template files.  Common mistakes include typos, incorrect extensions, or omitting directories.

This repository includes examples demonstrating both the problematic configuration and the corrected version.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to `bug` directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Observe that the styles are not applied
5. Navigate to `bugSolution` directory
6. Run `npm install`
7. Observe that the styles are now applied
