```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...

module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/**/*.html'], // Correct paths
};
```
Ensure that the `content` array includes all directories containing your HTML, JS, JSX, TS, or TSX files where you use Tailwind classes.  This could involve adding additional paths or correcting typos in existing paths.  Verify that the file extensions (`.html`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`) match the actual files. You might need to explicitly specify paths for files outside your `src` directory if they also contain Tailwind classes.  The solution also demonstrates including a wider range of file types and paths within the `content` option to ensure full coverage.
